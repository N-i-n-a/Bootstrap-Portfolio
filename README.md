# Challenge Week Three: Bootstrap Portfolio

## Description
This week's challenge is to adapt our Portfolio layout by using Bootstrap CSS.

> Bootstrap is a widely-used CSS library that takes out much of the work in designing a website with stylesheets. When we link Bootstrap's customized CSS files into our HTML, we can use its pre-defined HTML classes to style our pages, without having to write CSS on our own! This can save us time when building out a website, allowing us to focus on things like app functionality instead of getting padding or margins just right.
